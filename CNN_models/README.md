# CNN model implimentation on MNIST & Fashion MNIST

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using PyTorch, with key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. It includes two primary implementations: a custom CNN model and a version leveraging ResNet for enhanced feature extraction. Additionally, various image transformations are applied to observe their impact on model performance.

## Key Features
- **Datasets**: MNIST & Fashion MNIST
- **Libraries Used**: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Models**: Custom CNN, ResNet
- **Data Transformations**: Rotation, Normalization, Scaling, etc.
- **Documentation**: Detailed analysis of model performance and impact of transformations (see `docs`).
